Postmortem Report: Power BI App Outage
Issue Summary
Duration of Outage:
Start: August 15, 2024, 14:00 UTC
End: August 15, 2024, 16:30 UTC

Impact:
The Power BI app was completely down during the outage. Users were unable to access dashboards or reports, leading to significant disruption in data analytics operations. Approximately 80% of users were affected.

Root Cause:
The root cause was the destruction of the primary database server hosting the Power BI datasets due to an unforeseen hardware failure.

Timeline
14:00 UTC: Issue detected via automated monitoring alert indicating server unresponsiveness.
14:05 UTC: Incident confirmed by on-call engineer; initial investigation begins.
14:15 UTC: Assumption made that the issue was related to network connectivity; network team contacted.
14:30 UTC: Network team confirms no issues on their end; database team notified.
14:45 UTC: Database team identifies that the primary database server is down.
15:00 UTC: Escalation to IT infrastructure team to investigate the hardware status of the server.
15:15 UTC: IT infrastructure team confirms server destruction due to hardware failure.
15:30 UTC: Decision made to restore service using the latest backup and failover to a secondary server.
16:00 UTC: Data restoration process initiated from the latest backup.
16:30 UTC: Data restoration completed; service fully restored and operational.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:
The primary database server, hosting the Power BI datasets, experienced an unforeseen hardware failure leading to its destruction. This caused the entire Power BI service to become unavailable.

Resolution:
To resolve the issue, the following steps were taken:

The IT infrastructure team confirmed the hardware failure and determined that the primary server was irrecoverable.
The decision was made to switch to the secondary server and initiate data restoration.
The latest backup was used to restore the datasets on the secondary server.
After successful data restoration, the Power BI app was brought back online.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements and Fixes:

Implement a more robust failover strategy to ensure seamless transition to secondary servers in case of primary server failure.
Enhance monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect hardware failures earlier.
Regularly test disaster recovery plans to ensure quick and effective response to similar incidents.
Specific Tasks:

Patch Database Server: Ensure all database servers are updated with the latest firmware and patches.
Enhance Monitoring: Implement advanced monitoring tools to detect and alert on hardware anomalies.
Backup Validation: Regularly validate the integrity and completeness of backups.
Failover Testing: Conduct quarterly failover and disaster recovery drills.
Documentation Update: Update incident response documentation to include steps for handling hardware failures.
This postmortem aims to provide a detailed analysis of the outage, its causes, and the steps taken to resolve it. By addressing the identified issues, we can improve the reliability and resilience of our Power BI service.
